## Scrollspy Functionality

This project incorporates a scrollspy feature to enhance the user experience. The scrollspy functionality is implemented using JavaScript to dynamically highlight the active navigation item based on the user's scroll position within the page.

### How it Works

1. **Navigation Links Highlighting:**
   - As you scroll through different sections of the website, the corresponding navigation links in the header are dynamically highlighted to indicate the active section.

2. **Smooth Scrolling:**
   - Clicking on navigation links smoothly scrolls to the respective section on the page, providing a seamless navigation experience.

### Implementation Details

- **JavaScript:**
  - The scrollspy functionality is implemented using JavaScript, detecting the scroll position and updating the active state of navigation links accordingly.

- **HTML Structure:**
  - The HTML structure is designed to include section IDs corresponding to the navigation links.

- **CSS Styling:**
  - CSS styles are applied to highlight the active state of the navigation links.

### Example Code Snippet

```javascript
// Add an event listener for scroll events
window.addEventListener('scroll', function () {
    // Your scrollspy logic goes here to update active state
    // Example: Update active state based on scroll position
});

```

Feel free to customize the example code based on your specific implementation. This scrollspy feature contributes to a more user-friendly and interactive browsing experience.
